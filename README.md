I created a bash script that uses msfvenom to converts cmd or powershell commands to shellcode to be used with custom shellcode launchers of your choice.

I got the idee of youtube when I saw Gemini Security bypassig defender with open source shellcode launchers. My idea was to use my own custom reverse shells that was obfuscate or encoded with these launchers, ofcourse to make it happen I would nee to convert the entire powershell command to shellcode to be able to execute it and that is where this script was born.


Setup & Usage

1.Copy and paste the script to your linux enviroment.

2.Save the script as anything you want.

3.Make the script executable by running (chmod +x filename)
